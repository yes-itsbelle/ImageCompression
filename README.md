The Image Compression Program Explained Simply
The C++ program is like a mini-tool that shows how computers can make image files smaller. It uses two main ways to do this: one that keeps all the details (lossless) and one that makes the file much smaller by removing some details you might not even notice (lossy).
What The Program Does:
1.	Loads an Image: 
It starts by opening an image file (like the input.png). It reads all the tiny color dots (pixels) that make up the picture.

2.	Tries "Perfect" Compression (Lossless - RLE):
•	Idea: Imagine you have a long line of the same color, like BBBBBBBBB. Instead of writing each 'B', you could just write 9B (9 times the letter B). This saves space.
•	In the program, this is called Run-Length Encoding (RLE). It looks for long stretches of identical colors in the image.
•	Result: For most photos, this method actually makes the file bigger because photos usually don't have many long, identical color stretches. But it's "perfect" because if it does compress, you get exactly the same image back, pixel for pixel.

3.	Does "Smart" Compression (Lossy - Simplified DCT):
•	Idea: This is how most common image formats (like JPEG) work. Our eyes are good at seeing big changes in brightness, but not so good at tiny, subtle color differences or very fine details. So, why not get rid of those less important details to save a lot of space?
•	In the program:
It first uses a math trick called Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to change the image data into a form that highlights the important (big changes) and less important (tiny details) parts.
•	Then comes the "lossy" part (Quantization): It throws away (or "rounds off") the less important details. You control how much is thrown away with the quality factor (e.g., 10 in the code). A higher number means more details are thrown away, making the file smaller but potentially looking a bit worse.
Finally, it converts the data back into a picture.
•	Result: This method creates a new image file (output_compressed.png) that is usually much smaller than the original. It also tells you a PSNR number: a higher PSNR means the compressed image looks more like the original.


In Simple Terms:
The program shows that:
•	Lossless compression is like neatly folding clothes to fit in a suitcase – everything is still there, just packed tighter. (Often not great for photos).
•	Lossy compression is like deciding what clothes you really need and leaving some behind to make the suitcase much lighter. You might miss a sock, but the suitcase is much easier to carry! (Great for photos and web images).
The tradeoff can be seen: smaller file size often means a slight dip in image quality, and the program helps you see that in action.
